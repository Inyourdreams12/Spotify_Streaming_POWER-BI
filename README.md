- Blinding Lights by The Weeknd (nearly 4 billion streams), Shape of You by Ed Sheeran (3.6 billion streams), and Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi (2.9 billion streams) all represent the Pop genre to some extent. This suggests that Pop music remains a highly popular choice among Spotify users.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
- The top-streamed song has achieved a stream count that is 6.2 times higher than the average number of streams per year (514.14 million streams). This indicates exceptional popularity compared to the typical listening behavior on Spotify.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Most songs in were released on Fridays, with the highest number of releases occurring in May, November, October, and December. "New Music Friday" has become a common practice in the music industry, with many artists and labels strategically releasing new songs on Fridays to potentially capitalize on increased weekend listening activity.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
